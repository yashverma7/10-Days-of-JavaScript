REACT DOM
Document Object Model, is a World Wide Web Consortium standard logical representation of any webpage. 
In easier words, DOM is a tree-like structure that contains all the elements and it’s properties of a website as its nodes. 
DOM provides a language-neutral interface that allows accessing and updating of the content of any element of a webpage. 

1. render() - used to render a single React Component or several Components wrapped together in a Component or a div element.
2. findDOMNode() - This function is generally used to get the DOM node where a particular React component was rendered. 
3. unmountComponentAtNode() -  This function is used to unmount or remove the React Component that was rendered to a particular container.
4. hydrate() -  This method is equivalent to the render() method but is implemented while using server-side rendering. 
5. createPortal() - Usually, when an element is returned from a component’s render method, it’s mounted on the DOM as a child of the nearest parent node which in some cases may not be desired.
                    Portals allow us to render a component into a DOM node that resides outside the current DOM hierarchy of the parent component.
